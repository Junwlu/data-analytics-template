# Fianl Project: Evaluation of the sales situation of electronic games

According to PEW research[ https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/19/online-reviews/], consumers have long relied on advice and recommendations from others before making purchasing decisions, with 82% of American adults reading online customer ratings or reviews before purchasing new products. But does this mean that there is a strong correlation between the game's evaluation score and its sales? Specifically, what does a higher evaluation score mean for the sales of electronic games? Perhaps higher evaluation scores will greatly increase game sales, but will the choice of game platforms and publishers affect the ratings of electronic games? In other words, will more reliable game platforms and publishers lead to higher ratings for games? If so, what are the publishers with the highest sales recently? The publishers of higher rated games should correspond to those with higher sales.
In this project, I plan to use Metacritic's user and professional review ratings, as well as Kaggle's electronic game sales data, to explore whether high scoring games are more popular in the market. I will combine user and professional review ratings from Metacritic with electronic game sales data.
